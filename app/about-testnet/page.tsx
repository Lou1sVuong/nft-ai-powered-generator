      <p>
        A Testnet is a blockchain environment used for testing and
        experimentation without risking real assets or affecting the main
        network (Mainnet). It serves as a sandbox where developers, projects,
        and users can explore new features, test decentralized applications
        (dApps), and experiment with smart contracts in a risk-free manner.
